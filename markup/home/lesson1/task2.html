    <p align="justify"> Kaya Rose Humphrey was born on March 13, 1992 in Holloway, London, England.
        She was raised by her Brazilian mother in a council flat after her father left when she was one.
        She adopted her mother’s maiden name, Scodelario, and became fluent in Portuguese.
        Growing up, Scodelario was bullied at school about her dyslexia, frizzy hair, and petite frame.
        Acting became an outlet for her, where she gained confidence and she soon became passionate about the art.
        She then decided to pursue roles after playing the lead in her school’s production of Oliver.<br/> <br/>
        At the age of 14, Scodelario auditioned for a new E4 TV series called Skins. In order to get herself noticed,
        she claimed she was 16 on the forms, and asked the director for a light.
        The role originally went to another actress, but when she dropped out,
        Scodelario stepped in. She was cast as Effy Stonem, the younger sister of the show’s lead, Tony.
        The role grew over the years, from an almost-mute to queen bee, as the show decided to focus on
        Effy and her friends for series three and four.<br/> <br/>

        <br/> <br/> Effy was the only character to be featured in the first four
        seasons and Scodelario became one of the biggest breakouts of the series.
        After Skins, she filmed small supporting roles in Moon, Shank, and Clash of the Titans.
        She has appeared in music videos for British musicians Plan B, The Ruskins, and Robbie Williams.
        Scodelario also had a short stint at Models 1 modeling agency, but still continues to receive modeling
        jobs in order to promote her projects.<br/> <br/>
        Her big feature film debut came when Andrea Arnold cast her as Catherine Earnshaw in a new rendition of
        Wuthering Heights. Though Scodelario did not believe she was one for period drama, she was attracted to the
        role because of Arnold’s unconventional approach to the story. “I think a lot of people assume that
        ‘Wuthering Heights’ is this great love story, but I think the first thing [Arnold] said to me that it wasn’t,
        it’s very dark, deep and conflicting. It’s very kind of Gothic and a bit fucked up to be honest,” (WWD, 2011).<br/> <br/>
        The film played at several film festivals around the globe and was praised for its cinematography,
        art direction, and its use of natural sound. Scodelario was raved for her performance,
        and the role has opened more doors for her since then.</p>
    <p align="justify"> In 2011, Scodelario filmed roles for Twenty8k, Now Is Good, and a new improvisational TV series,
        True Love.
        <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d9/8c/f5/d98cf54de86488a73d521accdb70e6be.jpg" height="" width="497" align="left"> <!--image in the paragraph align left-->
        <br/> <br/> She then filmed her first American feature in January 2012 called The Truth About Emanuel,
        where she plays the title role, and was buzzed as a ‘Sundance darling’ when it premiered at the 2013 festival.
        Soon after, she participated in her first ad campaign with popular Korean jewelry brand, J.Estina,
        filmed BBC drama Southcliffe, and reprised her iconic role as Effy Stonem, for Skins Fire.
        <br/> <br/>2013 brought in many new aspects to her career. Scodelario decided to try her hand at a franchise,
        and scored the female lead of Teresa in The Maze Runner, based upon the popular YA series by James Dashner.
        She also completed a fashion film, Walking Stories, for Salvatore Ferragamo, and joined the cast of
        24 Hour Plays Celebrity Gala, a fundraiser for the Old Vic theatre. Next up, Scodelario will film home-invasion
        thriller, Tiger House, in Cape Town, South Africa, in the new year. Furthermore,
        she is attached to Stay With Me and Invisible, which are both currently in-development.<br/> <br/>
        She has stated that she loves being apart of a new generation of actors who are not professionally trained
        and have more of an edge. Scodelario’s heart currently resides in independent film, as it provides her with
        more of a learning experience, but would only consider Hollywood with the right role.
        “I don’t think that I could ever play just a ‘pretty girlfriend’ or just a stereotypical female part that’s
        just there to get her tits out – that just doesn’t interest me at all, really.
        I just want to keep pushing myself with every role and keep pushing myself with every film,”
        she says (Topman, 2013). Amongst her hobbies, Scodelario enjoys watching her favourite bands in concert,
        such as the Rolling Stones and Arctic Monkeys.<br/> <br/>
        She has a fun, lovable crush on Austrian actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and even named her french bulldog,
        ‘Arnie’, after him. Scodelario is also a generous individual, and enjoys working with a few charities,
        most recently, Let’s Get Talking. LGT is a charity which encourages open discussion for teens to raise
        awareness of health and crime prevention amongst our youth.

        I don't think that I could ever play just a 'pretty girlfriend' or just a stereotypical female part that's just
        there to get her tits out - that just doesn't interest me at all, really. I just want to keep pushing myself with
        every role and keep pushing myself with every film.<br/> <br/>
        I felt there needed to be a show for teenagers that didn't make them feel judged.
        'Skins' never tried to preach. It allowed young people to make their own decisions about what to do and whether
        it was right or wrong. Young people really respond to that, and that's what sets 'Skins' apart.
        I like the idea of up-and-coming actors nowadays being a little different and not necessarily the drama-school
        stereotype, being a bit more edgy.
        <br/> <br/>She speaks Portuguese.
        "My mum is Brazilian and very proud," Kaya Scodelario told Interview magazine.
        "I'd love to do a Brazilian film. I've been brought up in the Brazilian culture.
        My mum brought me up on my own. I cook Brazilian food. I've never spoken a word of English to my mother."
        <br/> <br/> She is admittedly not a fashionista.
        Speaking to the Telegraph, Scodelario said fashion is not her forte.
        "I always feel a bit out of place. It's just not me - high heels and designer dresses -
        and I can't seem to get used to it," she said.
        She likes working with newbies. <br/> <br/>

        Scodelario told Pop Sugar that while she respects Jennifer Lawrence's and
        Kristen Stewart's careers, she does not intend to follow their footsteps and
        would like to work with up and coming actors instead of Hollywood bigwigs.
        <br/> <br/> She will always say "no" to two-dimensional female roles.
        "I was raised by my mother alone," she explained to Teen magazine about the decision.
        "She's one of the strongest women in the world. So for me, it's very, very important to
        show it - and especially that young girls can be inspirational."
        She uses her mother's surname and only met his father shortly before he died. <br/> <br/>
        Kaya Scodelario grew up without a father. She only got to meet him face-to-face and
        interact with him in 2010, but he died the same year. The actress said the experience
        was nice, in such a way that she found out their similarities, but she would always
        regard her mom as both her mother and father. </p>
